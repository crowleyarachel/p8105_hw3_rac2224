  - There 134 unique aisles in the dataset “instacart”. The aisles with
    most items ordered include the “fresh vegetables” aisle with 150609
    orders, “fresh fruits” aisle with 150473 orders, the “packaged
    vegetables fruits” aisle with 78493 orders, the “yogurt” aisle with
    55240 orders, and the “packaged cheese” aisle with 41699 orders.

Plot for number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, n_distinct = n_distinct(aisle))%>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n >= 10000) %>%
    mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=(n))) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
    labs(
      title = "Number of orders per aisle for aisles with 10,000 orders or more",
      x = "Aisle",
      y = "Number of orders",
      caption = "Data from Instacart"
    )
```

![](p8105_hw3_rac2224_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Based on the plot created above, the aisles with most items ordered
    include the “fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetables
    fruits”, “yogurt” and “packaged cheese” aisles, which supports
    previous conclusions made regarding the aisles with most items
    ordered. Fresh vegetables has the most items ordered, and butter has
    the least items ordered. The number of orders for the majority of
    aisles presented stays below 40,000, until there is a sharp and
    almost exponential increase in the number of orders seen for the
    aisles “fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetavles
    fruits”, “yogurt” and “packaged cheese”.

  - In 2010, the following states were observed at 7 or more locations:
    WA, TX, SC, PA, OH , NY, NJ, NE, NC, MD, MA, FL, CO, CA.

Dataset limited to excellent responses, averaging data\_value across
locations

``` r
brfss_excellent = brfss_smart2010[which(brfss_smart2010$response=='Excellent'), 1:23] %>%
   select(year, locationabbr, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) 
ggplot(data = brfss_excellent, aes(x = year, y = mean_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) + geom_line() +
  labs(
      title = "Average value over time within each state",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Mean Value",
      caption = "Data from BRFSS"
    ) + 
   scale_color_hue(name = "State")
```

  - Based of the spaghetti plot made above showing the average value
    over time within each state, the mean value fluctuates differently
    over time depending on the state, with great variation between
    states when comparing the same year, as well as great variation
    within a state when comparing across years.

Making a two-panel
plot

``` r
brfss_panel = brfss_smart2010[which(brfss_smart2010$locationabbr=='NY'), 1:23] 
brfss_panel$response <- factor(brfss_panel$response,levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
brfss_panel = brfss_panel[which(brfss_panel$year=='2006' | brfss_panel$year =='2010'), 1:23] 
  panel1 = 
    brfss_panel %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
      title = "Data values by response type in NY comparing 2006 and 2010",
      x = "Response",
      y = "Data Values",
      caption = "Data from BRFSS"
    )
  panel1 + facet_grid(rows = vars(year))
