  - There 134 unique aisles in the dataset “instacart”. The aisles with
    most items ordered include the “fresh vegetables” aisle with 150609
    orders, “fresh fruits” aisle with 150473 orders, the “packaged
    vegetables fruits” aisle with 78493 orders, the “yogurt” aisle with
    55240 orders, and the “packaged cheese” aisle with 41699 orders.

Plot for number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, n_distinct = n_distinct(aisle))%>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n >= 10000) %>%
    mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=(n))) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
    labs(
      title = "Number of orders per aisle for aisles with 10,000 orders or more",
      x = "Aisle",
      y = "Number of orders",
      caption = "Data from Instacart"
    )
```

![](p8105_hw3_rac2224_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Based on the plot created above, the aisles with most items ordered
    include the “fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetables
    fruits”, “yogurt” and “packaged cheese” aisles, which supports
    previous conclusions made regarding the aisles with most items
    ordered. Fresh vegetables has the most items ordered, and butter has
    the least items ordered. The number of orders for the majority of
    aisles presented stays below 40,000, until there is a sharp and
    almost exponential increase in the number of orders seen for the
    aisles “fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetavles
    fruits”, “yogurt” and “packaged cheese”.

  - In 2010, the following states were observed at 7 or more locations:
    WA, TX, SC, PA, OH , NY, NJ, NE, NC, MD, MA, FL, CO, CA.

Dataset limited to excellent responses, averaging data\_value across
locations

``` r
brfss_excellent = brfss_smart2010[which(brfss_smart2010$response=='Excellent'), 1:23] %>%
   select(year, locationabbr, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) 
ggplot(data = brfss_excellent, aes(x = year, y = mean_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) + geom_line() +
  labs(
      title = "Average value over time within each state",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Mean Value",
      caption = "Data from BRFSS"
    ) + 
   scale_color_hue(name = "State")
```

  - Based of the spaghetti plot made above showing the average value
    over time within each state, the mean value fluctuates differently
    over time depending on the state, with great variation between
    states when comparing the same year, as well as great variation
    within a state when comparing across years.

Making a two-panel
plot

``` r
brfss_panel = brfss_smart2010[which(brfss_smart2010$locationabbr=='NY'), 1:23] 
brfss_panel$response <- factor(brfss_panel$response,levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
brfss_panel = brfss_panel[which(brfss_panel$year=='2006' | brfss_panel$year =='2010'), 1:23] 
  panel1 = 
    brfss_panel %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
      title = "Data values by response type in NY comparing 2006 and 2010",
      x = "Response",

  - For both 2006 and 2010 in NY, the smallest data values are
    distributed among the poor response category and the data values
    increase going from poor to fair, and from fair to good; however, in
    2006, the data values distributed among the very good category
    appear to slightly decrease in comparison to the good category, and
    decreases even more from very good to excellent. In contrast, in
    2010, the data values continue to slightly increase from the good to
    very good category, and the values distributed among the excellent
    variable are lower in value in comparison to the very good category.
    The distribution of data values for the poor response is the
    smallest for both 2006 and 2010, whereas the distribution of data
    values is wider for all other response categories in 2006 and 2010.
    In 2006, the distribution of data values for response categories
    good, very good, and excellent overlap. Similarly, in 2010, the
    distribution of data values for response categories good, very good,
    and excellent overlap, as well as slightly for the distribution of
    data values for response categories fair and excellent.

## Problem 3

Load, tidy, and wrangle accel\_data

``` r
accel_data = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
accel_data = janitor::clean_names(accel_data) 
day = as.factor(pull(accel_data, day))
day <- factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"), ordered = TRUE)
levels(day)
```

    ## [1] "Monday"    "Tuesday"   "Wednesday" "Thursday"  "Friday"    "Saturday" 
    ## [7] "Sunday"

``` r
accel_data %>%
  mutate(
    weekend_v_weekday = case_when(
      day < 6 ~ "weekday",
      day >= 6 ~ "weekend",
      TRUE      ~ ""
    ))

  - The number of observations in the dataset accel\_data is 35. With
    the addition of the weekend\_v\_weekday variable, the number of
    columns in the dataset accel\_data is 1444. The variables in the
    dataset accel\_data are week, day\_ID, day, activity\_1 through
    activity\_1440, and weekend\_v\_weekday. The dimensions of the
    dataset accel\_data are 35, 1444. The number of missing values in
    the dataset accel\_data is 0 since there are 50505 values labeled as
    false for missing.

Total activity level per day

  - When looking at the total activity each day for the 35 day study
    period, there appears to be no trends in the level of activity, as
    the highest levels of total activity are from weekdays and weekends
    from the beginning and end of the study period, while the lowest
    levels of activity also include weekdays and weekends from the
    beginning and end of the study period. This data does not show a
    trend in the level of activity by day of week, or day of the study
    period.
