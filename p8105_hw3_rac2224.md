Describing the Dataset “instacart”

Dataset size and structure

  - The number of observations in the dataset instacart is 1384617. The
    number of columns in the dataset instacart is 15. The variables in
    the dataset instacart are order\_id, product\_id,
    add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
    order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
    product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department. The
    dimensions of the dataset instacart are 1384617, 15.
  - The structure of the variables within the dataset instacart are as
    follows: order\_id is an integer, product\_id is an integer,
    add\_to\_cart\_order is an integer, reordered is an integer,
    user\_id is an integer, eval\_set is a character, order\_number is
    an integer, order\_dow is an integer, order\_hour\_of\_day is an
    integer, days\_since\_prior\_order is an integer, product\_name is a
    character, aisle\_id is an integer, department\_id is an integer,
    aisle is a character, and department is a character.

Key variable description

  - The min, max, mean, and median of each of the integer variables are
    as follows: for order\_ID, the minimum is 1, the maximum is 3421070,
    the mean is 1.706297610^{6}, and the median is 1701880; for
    product\_ID, the minimum is 1, the maximum is 49688, the mean is
    2.555623610^{4}, and the median is 25298; for add\_to\_cart\_order,
    the minimum is 1, the maximum is 80, the mean is 8.7580443, and the
    median is 7; for reordered, the minimum is 0, the maximum is 1, the
    mean is 0.5985944, and the median is 1; for user\_id, the minimum is
    1, the maximum is 206209, the mean is 1.031127810^{5}, and the
    median is 102933; for order\_number, the minimum is 4, the maximum
    is 100, the mean is 17.0914101, and the median is 11; for
    order\_dow, the minimum is 0, the maximum is 6, the mean is
    2.7013918, and the median is 3; for order\_hour\_of\_day, the
    minimum is 0, the maximum is 23, the mean is 13.5775922, and the
    median is 14; for days\_since\_prior\_order, the minimum is 0, the
    maximum is 30, the mean is 17.0661259, and the median is 15; for
    aisle\_id, the minimum is 1, the maximum is 134, the mean is
    71.30423, and the median is 83; and for department\_id, the minimum
    is 1, the maximum is 21, the mean is 9.8397774, and the median is 8.
  - The number of missing observations for each variable are as follows:
    for order\_id is 0, for product\_id is 0, for add\_to\_cart\_order
    is 0, for reordered is 0, for user\_id is 0, for eval\_set is 0, for
    order\_number is 0, for order\_dow is 0, for order\_hour\_of\_day is
    0, for days\_since\_prior\_order is 0, for product\_name is 0, for
    aisle\_id is 0, for department\_id is 0, for aisle is 0, and for
    department is 0.

Examples of observations

  - The mean order hour of day for products from the produce department
    is 13.5597245, the mean order hour of day for products from the
    frozen department is 13.8093223, and the mean order hour of day for
    products from the household department is 13.447813. The largest
    number of days since prior order for an order that included
    something from the eggs aisle is 30 and for an order that included
    something from the coffee aisle is 30.
